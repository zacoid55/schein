### How to run

1. Run the `npm install` command to install the relevant packages
2. Then run `npm run cypress:run` to run the tests in the CLI or `npm run cypress:open` to run the tests in the Cypress Launcher

### Locations
The test file is in the `e2e` directory and all relevant code is in the `support` directory

### Please note
There is a current issue with Cypress and saucedemo.com right now so if you run into issues with retrying the tests in the Launcher, please follow the steps found here: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27501#issuecomment-1722403606
